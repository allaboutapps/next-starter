This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.

## Builds
- Builds are configured as `standalone` in next.config.mjs. SPA style builds (aka `output: "export"`) are not practical,
since dynamic routes without `generateStaticParams()` are not supported (see https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/deploying/static-exports#unsupported-features). This limitation would not allow any detail sites like `product/[productId]` because those cannot be generated statically.
