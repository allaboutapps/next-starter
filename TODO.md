- add tests
- remove locale from generalStore -> change useLocale() to use window.location so it's independent of NextJS
- add back show string keys and other debug functions (e.g. debugLog)
- i18n auto detect via accept-language (see next intl docs)
- better test pages (from react-starter)
- maybe get rid of general store runtime environment? handle via global var?
